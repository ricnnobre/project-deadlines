# Project-Deadlines

This is an R code to bring project deadlines from Jira software and show them to the manager.

The projects developed in the IT area have delivery deadlines that need to be monitored and later collected in order to ensure that the  SLAs are met.

The IT contract include any penalties as a result of a missed SLA by a project. 

These penalties range from a formal warning to even 5% of total value of the bill to be charged as penalty.
